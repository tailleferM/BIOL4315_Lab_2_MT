```
6.
mean length increased to 6,914.58 from 4,888.03
length range changed
plots:

more symmetrical seq length distribution
per base q distribution: higher proportion of good q   score accross board, shape generally same, better high pos end <- due to removal of super long seq(why did filtlong do this?)
Per pos quality percentiles: read end v similar
read start similar shape, bigger initial drop but then higher avg afterwards
Per seq avg q scores: higher percentile across board
per pos base content: similar
rest of stuff similar
